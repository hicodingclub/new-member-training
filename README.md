 # New Quality Assurance Member Training
 All things a new QA member need to know to get on the right track of becoming a better contributor

 ## QA Overview 
 Welcome to HiCoding Club! My name is Eric and I am in charge of managing the Quality Assurance part of the club. Before you guys officially contribute as a QA member, you will complete a training session in order to familiarize yourself with GitHub and setting up the environment on your computer. 


 ## QA Training 
 All training materials will be assigned and posted to you under the "Issue" tab. Upon completion, simply close the issue for review. 

 ## Questions or Concerns? 
 If there are any questions or concerns, feel free to email or text me. My email is eric.sheng495@gmail.com. 
 Thanks again for being apart of the Quality Assurance Team.
